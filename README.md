# IAM-Perovskite

# Overall Use Instructions
This repository was prepared for the analysis of perovskite tandem PV development, incorporating spatiotemporal characteristics.

Future Scenarios:

·The IMAGE 3.2 model was selected as the primary source of Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios.
·The Premise tool was used to integrate IAM scenario information into the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database.
LCA Database:

LCA Databse:
The baseline LCA database is based on Ecoinvent 3.8.
Subsequent LCA analyses were conducted using the IAM-enhanced LCA databases generated with Premise, Python, and Brightway.
Database Features:

The generated databases incorporate temporal (year-specific) and regional characteristics, facilitating comprehensive downstream analyses.
